Phase 1: Quick Wins
Build a Simple Web Interface:

Add a real-time code explanation feature for DevOps scripts.

Example: A student uploads a Terraform file, and the LLaMA model explains each block of code.

Add Basic User Authentication:

No changes needed here.

Enable Teachers to Upload Content:

Add a feature for teachers to upload interactive coding exercises (e.g., Terraform scripts, Ansible playbooks).

Phase 2: Core Features
Personalized Study Plans:

Use the LLaMA model to create personalized learning paths based on student progress and goals.

Example: If a student is struggling with Kubernetes, recommend a learning path on Kubernetes basics.

Individual Assessments:

Add debugging assistance to assessments.

Example: Provide a broken CI/CD pipeline configuration and ask the student to debug it.

Teacher Dashboard:

Add progress tracking metrics to the dashboard.

Example: Display the number of students who completed a specific DevOps project.

Phase 3: Advanced Features
Interactive Coding Environment:

Create a sandbox environment for students to write and test DevOps scripts.

Example: Allow students to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform in a sandbox environment.

Gamification:

Add badges and points for completing interactive coding exercises and debugging tasks.

Community Features:

Allow students to share debugging tips and DevOps scripts in discussion forums.

Phase 4: Competing with Established Players
AI-Powered Code Review:

Use the LLaMA model to analyze and review DevOps scripts.

Example: Provide feedback on a student's Terraform configuration.

Virtual Labs:

Integrate with cloud providers to create hands-on labs for DevOps tools.

Example: Provide a lab for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

Certification Programs:

Use assessments and hands-on projects to determine if students are ready for certification.
